- HTML elements.
- CSS styling.
- Javascript.
- Python-Flask
- Images.
- Text/Copy.

## Project Brief

Incredibly, the developers of this whole projects wanted to bring the idea of booking a house, buying a home, rent a an airbnb apartment be a button away at your comfortability zone.
KerryKogei being the scrum master has put together fellow collegues to participate in the app to make sure it is a success.

## Getting Started

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) this repo to your Github account.
2. Clone (download) your fork to your computer.
3. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates).

   - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Preston-Too/FIND-A-HOME.git`
   - `git pull upstream master`
   - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

4. Find a task [here](https://github.com/Preston-Too/FIND-A-HOME.git/issues) or [create a task](https://github.com/Preston-Too/FIND-A-HOME.git/issues)
   - Comment on the task to claim it, ensuring no-body has done so already.
   - If you created a new task or issue, ensure you specify if you are undertaking the task or if someone else is able to claim it.
   - Keep the issue updated with your progress, inactive issues will be reassigned.
5. Create a branch for your task and complete the task.
6. Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to ensure we still have the latest code.
   - `git pull upstream master`
7. Commit and push the code to your fork.
8. Create a pull request to have the changes merged into the origin.
   - Ensure you add to the comments of the pull request `fixes #<issue number>`, replacing **<issue number>** with the number of your issue will automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged.

> Congratulations! Have Fun and Happy Coding!!!
